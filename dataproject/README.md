# Dataproject

## Municipality Budget Planning
Our project examines Danish municipalities' budgeting and their ability to predict net expenditure per capita. We further examine for any correlation
between population size and the municipality's estimate for expenditure per capita. 

The project can be read in [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb). 

The project depends on plotter.py to make some graphs. The entire folder must therefore be downloaded in order to make the notebook run.


## The folder

README.md	           : The file you are reading

dataproject (folder)	   : dataproject module containing custom python modules 

Dataproject.ipynb	   : The Jupyter notebook containing the project


## Requirements
The dataproject requires the following libraries to run: pydst, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas. It further depends on the Plotter.py module, 
which makes use of the tkinter library
